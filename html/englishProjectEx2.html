<h2>Google maps popular Grand Canyon hiking trails with backpack-mounted cameras</h2>
<h4><i>By Felicia Fonseca Associated Press San Jose Mercury News</i></h4>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. -- Google (GOOG) and its street-view cameras already <a style="color:red">have</a> taken users to narrow
cobblestone alleys <a style="color:red">in</a> Spain using a tricycle, inside the Smithsonian with a push cart and <a style="color:red">to</a>
British Columbia's snow-covered slopes by snowmobile.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
The search giant now has brought its all-seeing eyes -- mounted for the first time on a backpack -- down <a style="color:red">into</a>
the Grand Canyon, <a style="color:red">showcasing</a> the attraction's most popular hiking trails on the South Rim and other <a style="color:red">walkways</a>.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
It's the <a style="color:red">latest</a> evolution in mapping technology for the Mountain View Company, which <a style="color:red">has</a>
used a rosette of cameras to photograph thousands of cities and towns in dozens of countries for its Street View feature.
With a click of the mouse, Internet users are transported virtually for a 360-degree view of locales they may have read
<a style="color:red">about</a> only in tourist books and <a style="color:red">seen</a> in flat, 2-D images.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
"Any of these sorts of iconic, cultural, historical locations that are not <a style="color:red">accessible</a> by road is where we want to go,"
said Ryan Falor, product manager at Google.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
Google announced the trekker earlier this year but made its first official collection of data this week <a style="color:red">at</a> the Grand Canyon.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
The backpacks <<a style="color:red">are</a> not ready for volunteer use, but Google <a style="color:red">has</a> said it wants to deploy them
<a style="color:red">at</a> national forests, <a style="color:red">to</a> the narrow streets of Venice, Mount Everest and
<a style="color:red">to</a> ancient ruins and castles.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
The move to capture the Grand Canyon comes after Apple (AAPL) chose to drop Google Maps from its mobile <a style="color:red">operating systems<a/>
and opted to use <a style="color:red">its</a> own mapping program that was derided for, among other things, poor directions and missing towns.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
Steve Silverman, operations manager for Google <a style="color:red">did not</a> directly address the competition <a style="color:red">in</a>
saying: "Just trying to document a trail, it's going to be hard to beat this."
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
Google <a style="color:red">launched</a> its Street View feature in 2007 and has expanded from five U.S. cities to <a style="color:red">more</a>
than 3,000 in 43 countries. Google teams and volunteers have covered more than 5 million miles with the Street View vehicles on a
<a style="color:red">scale</a> that other companies <a style="color:red">have not</a> approached, said Mike Dobson, president
of Telemapics, a <a style="color:red">company</a> that monitors mapping efforts.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
"You could safely say that it's a standout, well-used application and they don't really have <a style="color:red">any</a> competition," he said.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
As the sun rose Monday, Luc Vincent, Google engineering director, strapped on one of the 40-pound backpacks and set down the Bright Angel Trail to
the Colorado River -- a nearly 10-mile hike that goes <a style="color:red">from</a> 6,900 feet <a style="color:red">in</a>
elevation <a style="color:red">to</a> 2,400 feet. He hiked back up from Phantom Ranch, which can be 30 degrees warmer than at the rim,
<a style="color:red">through</a> the South Kaibab Trail and also gathered <a style="color:red">data</a> on other trails.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
The so-<a style="color:red">called</a> trekker captures images <a style="color:red">every</a> 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels
each from the rest areas, the steep switchbacks, the change from juniper trees to scrub brush and the traffic that moves <a style="color:red">aside</a>
as a courtesy to mule riders.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
The GPS data is <a style="color:red">limited</a>, so Google must compensate with sensors that record temperature, vibrations and the orientation
of the device <a style="color:red">as</a> it changes, before it stitches the images together and makes them <a style="color:red">available</a>
to users in a few months, Falor said.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
Hikers that <a style="color:red">were</a> on the trail when the data was gathered will <a style="color:red">have</a> their faces blurred --
an attempt by Google to ensure <a style="color:red">privacy</a>. Street View has run <a style="color:red">into</a> problems in places like
Europe and Australia for scooping up information transmitted over unsecured wireless networks.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
A removable hard drive on the trekker <a style="color:red">stores</a> the data gathered at the Grand Canyon. Tourists <a style="color:red">looked</a>
at the trekker strangely this week, <a style="color:red">as</a> if it was something from outer space.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
Sharon Kerfoot, a first-<<a style="color:red">time</a> visitor from Alberta said being <a style="color:red">able to</a> view the terrain ahead of time,
gauge the difficulty of the <a style="color:red">hike</a> and know just how wide the path is would benefit those considering a trip to the Grand Canyon.
She and a group of friends headed <a style="color:red">down</a> the same path as Vincent but on mules, not foot.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
"I think it's an <a style="color:red">excellent</a> idea to give people a broader perspective on what they're getting <a style="color:red">into</a>," she said.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
What the images <a style="color:red">will not</a> tell visitors is how <a style="color:red">much</a> water they should carry down the trails,
how to <a style="color:red">prepare</a> for temperature changes, <a style="color:red">what</a> type of food to bring and how <a style="color:red">much</a>
, and how best to protect the natural resources, park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">
"Stitched together with other information out there, the technology could be <a style="color:red">valuable</a>," she said.
