    <p>
        GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. -- Google (GOOG) and its street-view cameras already <a>#1</a> taken users to narrow
        cobblestone alleys <a>#2</a> Spain using a tricycle, inside the Smithsonian with a push cart and <a>#3</a>
        British Columbia's snow-covered slopes by snowmobile.
    </p>

    <p>
        The search giant now has brought its all-seeing eyes -- mounted for the first time on a backpack -- down <a>#4</a>
        the Grand Canyon, <a>#5</a> the attraction's most popular hiking trails on the South Rim and other <a>#6</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's the <a>#7</a> evolution in mapping technology for the Mountain View Company, which <a>#8</a>
        used a rosette of cameras to photograph thousands of cities and towns in dozens of countries for its Street View feature.
        With a click of the mouse, Internet users are transported virtually for a 360-degree view of locales they may have read
        <a>#9</a> only in tourist books and <a>#10</a> in flat, 2-D images.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Any of these sorts of iconic, cultural, historical locations that are not <a>#11</a> by road is where we want to go,"
        said Ryan Falor, product manager at Google.
    </p>

    <p>
        Google announced the trekker earlier this year but made its first official collection of data this week <a>#12</a> the Grand Canyon.
    </p>

    <p>
        The backpacks <a>#13</a> not ready for volunteer use, but Google <a>#14</a> said it wants to deploy them
        <a>#15</a> national forests, <a>#16</a> the narrow streets of Venice, Mount Everest and
        <a>#17</a> ancient ruins and castles.
    </p>

    <p>
        The move to capture the Grand Canyon comes after Apple (AAPL) chose to drop Google Maps from its mobile <a>#18</a>
        and opted to use <a>#19</a> own mapping program that was derided for, among other things, poor directions and missing towns.
    </p>

    <p>
        Steve Silverman, operations manager for Google <a>#20</a> directly address the competition <a>#21</a>
        saying: "Just trying to document a trail, it's going to be hard to beat this."
    </p>

    <p>
        Google <a>#22</a> its Street View feature in 2007 and has expanded from five U.S. cities to <a>#23</a>
        than 3,000 in 43 countries. Google teams and volunteers have covered more than 5 million miles with the Street View vehicles on a
        <a>#24</a> that other companies <a>#25</a> approached, said Mike Dobson, president
        of Telemapics, a <a>#26</a> that monitors mapping efforts.
    </p>

    <p>
        "You could safely say that it's a standout, well-used application and they don't really have <a>#27</a> competition," he said.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the sun rose Monday, Luc Vincent, Google engineering director, strapped on one of the 40-pound backpacks and set down the Bright Angel Trail to
        the Colorado River -- a nearly 10-mile hike that goes <a>#28</a> 6,900 feet <a>#29</a>
        elevation <a>#30</a> 2,400 feet. He hiked back up from Phantom Ranch, which can be 30 degrees warmer than at the rim,
        <a>#31</a> the South Kaibab Trail and also gathered <a>#32</a> on other trails.
    </p>

    <p>
        The so-<a>#33</a> trekker captures images <a>#34</a> 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels
        each from the rest areas, the steep switchbacks, the change from juniper trees to scrub brush and the traffic that moves <a>#35</a>
        as a courtesy to mule riders.
    </p>

    <p>
        The GPS data is <a>#36</a>, so Google must compensate with sensors that record temperature, vibrations and the orientation
        of the device <a>#37</a> it changes, before it stitches the images together and makes them <a>#38</a>
        to users in a few months, Falor said.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hikers that <a>#39</a> on the trail when the data was gathered will <a>#40</a> their faces blurred --
        an attempt by Google to ensure <a>#41</a>. Street View has run <a>#42</a> problems in places like
        Europe and Australia for scooping up information transmitted over unsecured wireless networks.
    </p>

    <p>
        A removable hard drive on the trekker <a>#43</a> the data gathered at the Grand Canyon. Tourists <a>#44</a>
        at the trekker strangely this week, <a>#45</a> if it was something from outer space.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sharon Kerfoot, a first-<a>#46</a> visitor from Alberta said being <a>#47</a> view the terrain ahead of time,
        gauge the difficulty of the <a>#48</a> and know just how wide the path is would benefit those considering a trip to the Grand Canyon.
        She and a group of friends headed <a>#49</a> the same path as Vincent but on mules, not foot.
    </p>

    <p>
        "I think it's an <a>#50</a> idea to give people a broader perspective on what they're getting <a>#51</a>," she said.
    </p>

    <p>
        What the images <a>#52</a> tell visitors is how <a>#53</a> water they should carry down the trails,
        how to <a>#54</a> for temperature changes, <a>#55</a> type of food to bring and how <a>#56</a>
        , and how best to protect the natural resources, park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Stitched together with other information out there, the technology could be <a>#57</a>," she said.
